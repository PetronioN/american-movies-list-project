<h3> Quick Summary </h3>

<p>In the project, processes of cleaning, treatment and analysis of the data available in the dataset were carried out. As it is a small dataset with a value of approximately 4000 rows, it didn't take such a big process with the project, since it didn't have many columns either.</p>

<p>Initially, an analysis was made of how the data would be and what are the possible inconsistencies with them.<br />

After the analysis is the treatment, in which changes were made that could bring inconsistencies to the views, such as the Release_Date column in its initial state.<br/>

After these two initial processes, we arrive at the views, where we have counts, max, min and other information that are relevant to insights.<br/>
